One thing to note is that kinetic energy and potential energy are approximately equal, with PE being slightly greater than the KE and then swapping as real time propagation goes on. The total energy is conserved though. Maybe try extending the real time frame later if issues arise to make sure the energy stablizes for a longer simulation time (??)"
